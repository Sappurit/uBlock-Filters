## Sappurit-uBlock-Filters
I collected all codes from [https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/)                
Special thanks to everyone who contributed the hard work.  
I have a little knowledge of CSS. I will try my best to maintain these lists.

To add my filters into uBlock, just click the RAW button and copy those link to your uBlock Dashboard > Filter lists > Import
